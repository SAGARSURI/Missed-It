# Missed It

Have you ever paused yourself and thought for a while about the things which really mattered to you back in your childhood days. Things which you cherised, things which the new or upcoming generation will never understand or hear about. I know you must be having your own lovely list of items to share. But before you do that I have created a showcase app where you might find your lovely item and laugh hard after seeing it. 

# About the app

"Missed it" app will be a part of the "Flutter create" challenge. It will showcase some valuable items which were really popular back in the era of 80's and 90's. These items are hard to find in use today but holds a lot of memories which are priceless. As of now it holds a limited set of items to display so as to respect the rule of "5KB" codebase size as mentioned in the challenge.
